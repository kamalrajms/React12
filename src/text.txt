## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.


    ## must need to install node.js
 
## procedure to initiate project

    step 1 : npm create vite@latest [project_name]
    step 2 : select react
    step 3 : select javascript+swc
    step 4 : npm install                // install node module packages
    step 5 : npm run dev

    if you want to re-run your project mean 
        npm run dev

## props

    Props is nothing but drilling data from parent to child component.

        Decleration of props
        destructuring of props

## Conditional rendering

    Conditional rendering means showing or hiding parts
    of UI based on some conditions (state,props..)

        Ternary Operator   (condition)?true:false
        Logical operator   &,|,!

## useState() And Form & controlled input

        Usestate is a React Hook taht allows you to add state (data that can change over time) 
        to a functional component.

        Normally , in javascript function, variables after disapper after the function runs.
        But with Usestate , react remeber value b/w re-render.

        syntex:
            const [state,setState]=Usestate(initiateValue)

        state---the current value of the state variables
        setState--- a function that updates the state
        initiateValue-- the starting value of the state.

## Styleing in react

    Global way Styleing----index.css,app.css
    Exteral way Styleing---- seperate Styleing file for a component
    module way Styleing --- while we are useing this way of Styleing mean  
                            ,we need to add file name as [filename.module.css] 
    inline Styleing--- style={{property:"value"}}
    Object way Styleing---

## useEffect()

    in react ,useEffect is a hook that lets you Perform side effect in functionl components.
    Side Effect are task  that happen outside the normal React rendering process,Like:

            Fetching data from API
            Updating  the brouser DOM manually
            Starting / stopping the timers.

        
        syntex:

            useEffect(()=>{
                //code...
            },[dependency 1,dependency 2,...])


            if we doesn't mension any dependency 
            means it will execute only once at the begining.

## UseRef()

    UseRef is a React Hook taht gives you a box(.current) you can store anythoing in- num,
    String,object,function,even DOM elements.

    That value Persists between renders.

    Updating it does not cause your component to re-render.

    {current:value}



## domain

    .com---commerical
    .org---Organization
    .net---network
    .edu---education
    .gov---Governmanet
    .mil---Military
    .co---Company
    .biz---Business
    .in---india

## useContext

    Passing the data from a parent component down to deeply nested  child component is annoying.
    Normally,you'd have to pass props manually through each level (called Props Drilling).
    useContext lets ypu skip all the middle component  and share data directly.

        Create a Context
        Provides a value
        Consume the value

## useReducer()

    syntex:

        const [state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducerFunction,initialState)


        state--- current state (Like:Usestate)
        dispatch (action)---  a function to tell the reducer what to do.
        reducerFunction (state,action)---the logic that returns a new state
        initialState--- starting value
    
## useCallback()

    Every time a component re-renders,
    It create a brand new copy of every function indide it

    Even if the function's code looks exactly the same,
    React sees it as different because it's a new object in menmory.

    syntex:

    const name=useCallback(()=>{
        // code...
    },[dependency 1,dependency 2,...])



    const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Clicked");
    };

    Every time the component re-renders, this function is recreated.

    If we pass this function to a child component, the child will also re-render — even if nothing changed.

    useCallback solves this problem.

## Routing in react and nested routing 

    Routing means navigating between  different pages in web app without refreshing the browser.
    In traditional websites ,clicking a link reloads the whole page.
    In react (A Single page application) , Routing lets us changes the view without reloading.

        better performance (no full reload)
        Smooth user experiance
        Control over navigation without sever request

    Commend: npm install react-router-dom

    basic structure:

        <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
        <Route path:"addtess path of a component" element={<Home/>}/>
        <Route path:"addtess path of a component" element={<About/>}/>
        <Route path:"addtess path of a component" element={<service/>}/>
        </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>


        BrowserRouter

            it is the main weapper component for routing in react App.
            It enables navigation using  the browser URL (history API).
            without this, routing will not work.

        Routes
            It contains all the  <Route/> component
            It tell  react Router to which component to shown for which path.
            Only one route will match and render at a time..

        Route
            Defines a specific URL Path and  which component should for that path.

## Useparam() -- routing dom

        useParams() is a React Router hook that lets you read dynamic values from the URL path (not from the query string).

		It’s commonly used when you have routes with dynamic segments like /users/:id or /products/:productId.

## useNavigate()-- routing dom

        useNavigate is also from react routing dom , it is used for navigation between components
        as functionaly.

## useId () 

    UseId is  react Hook that create a unique and stable ID for each component instance.

    when you bulid component like form or list ,you oftern need unique id..

## custom Hook

    A custom hook is a reusable function in react that contains logic using hooks(like Usestate,useEffect...)

    It allows you to share and reuse stateful logic between multiple component without repeating code .

    The name fo a custom hook must start with [use], such as useFetch,useLoaction.

## API integration

    fetch,axios

    commend:npm install axios


## axios structure

    response={
        data:[
            {id:1,name:"kumar},
            {id:1,name:"kumar},
            {id:1,name:"kumar},...],
        status:200,
        statusText:"OK",
        header:{},
        config:{},
    }

    console.log(response.data)
