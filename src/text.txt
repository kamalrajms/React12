## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.


    ## must need to install node.js

    step 2 : select react
    step 3 : select javascript+swc
    step 4 : npm install                // install node module packages

## Conditional rendering

    Conditional rendering means showing or hiding parts
    of UI based on some conditions (state,props..)

        Ternary Operator   (condition)?true:false
        Logical operator   &,|,!

## useState() And Form & controlled input

        Usestate is a React Hook taht allows you to add state (data that can change over time) 
        to a functional component.

        Normally , in javascript function, variables after disapper after the function runs.
        But with Usestate , react remeber value b/w re-render.

        syntex:
            const [state,setState]=Usestate(initiateValue)

        state---the current value of the state variables
        setState--- a function that updates the state
        initiateValue-- the starting value of the state.

## Styleing in react

    Global way Styleing----index.css,app.css
    Exteral way Styleing---- seperate Styleing file for a component
    module way Styleing --- while we are useing this way of Styleing mean  
                            ,we need to add file name as [filename.module.css] 
    inline Styleing--- style={{property:"value"}}
    Object way Styleing---

## useEffect()

    in react ,useEffect is a hook that lets you Perform side effect in functionl components.
    Side Effect are task  that happen outside the normal React rendering process,Like:

            Fetching data from API
            Updating  the brouser DOM manually
            Starting / stopping the timers.

        
        syntex:

            useEffect(()=>{
                //code...
            },[dependency 1,dependency 2,...])


            if we doesn't mension any dependency 
            means it will execute only once at the begining.

## UseRef()

    UseRef is a React Hook taht gives you a box(.current) you can store anythoing in- num,
    String,object,function,even DOM elements.

    That value Persists between renders.

    Updating it does not cause your component to re-render.

    {current:value}

## useContext

    Passing the data from a parent component down to deeply nested  child component is annoying.
    Normally,you'd have to pass props manually through each level (called Props Drilling).
    useContext lets ypu skip all the middle component  and share data directly.

        Create a Context
        Provides a value
        Consume the value

## useReducer()

    syntex:

        const [state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducerFunction,initialState)


        state--- current state (Like:Usestate)
        dispatch (action)---  a function to tell the reducer what to do.
        reducerFunction (state,action)---the logic that returns a new state
        initialState--- starting value
    
## useCallback()

    Every time a component re-renders,
    It create a brand new copy of every function indide it

    Even if the function's code looks exactly the same,
    React sees it as different because it's a new object in menmory.

    syntex:

    const name=useCallback(()=>{
        // code...
    },[dependency 1,dependency 2,...])
